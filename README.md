# Casino Odd Project

## Overview

The Casino Odd Project is an ambitious endeavor that seeks to demystify the complexities of casino game odds through a computational lens. By developing a C++ application to simulate various casino games, starting with Blackjack, this project aims to offer deep insights into gambling odds. Furthermore, it intends to bridge these simulations with a Python model dedicated to strategically analyzing and enhancing game outcomes, thus providing a comprehensive toolkit for understanding and potentially improving one's chances in casino games.
